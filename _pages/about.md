My name is Roman Roscoe, and I am a soon to be junior at Michigan State University. I am an aspiring computer science student, with 2 years of programming under my belt. I grew up in Milford Michigan. I enjoy sports such as martial arts and football, as I am both a black belt and was a football player. My favorite hobbies are programming (despite being new), chess, and weight lifting. Prior to being a computer science engineer in the College of Engineering, I was a chemistry major at the College of Natural Science at Michigan State.

My Goals:
======
- Go from being skilled in Python and C++, to a valued expert with the ability to independently create software
- Earn an internship, that gives me the ability to enhance my skills while learning what its like to be a Computer Scientist
- To be mentored by experts and fellow Computer Scientists
- To contribute in real world projects that effectively apply my skills
- Gain the ability to network and connect with others in my field

Education
======
  In highschool I attended the International Academy West, where I earned the prestigious IB diploma and focused on a STEM based curriculum. I went through rigorous IB standards, and achieved a 1420 on my SAT, and a 31 on my ACT. I graduated with a 4.1 GPA.
  As a Computer Science student at Michigant State, I my studies involve numerous classes to further my experience in computer science. These include:

Soft Skills
------
**Communicative** - As a result of my years as a black belt, I am able to communicate my thoughts and ideas very well, as I mentored countless students in a very complex sport such as martial arts.
**Analytical** - I earned an IB Diploma at the International Academy West, and my time there thought me how to meticulously plan and evaluate problems with a certain level of calmness. I was taught how to be a critical thinker, with the ability to speak up, and yet take in other's opinions without arrogance.
**Creative** - My background in sports, chess, music, and education, have all helped me to develop a creative mind, suited for problem solving. From the moment I took my first computer science class, I enjoyed the intuitiveness and the freedom that came with developing and debugging.
**Team Leader** -  As a captain of the football team and tournament team in highschool for martial arts, and the chess club president, I enjoy being at the forefront. I take initiative and pride in what I am passionate in.
**Open Minded** - My educational background humbled me in ways I couldn't imagine. I take pleasure in learning from my failures, growing is more important than being correct and having things my way. I understand I am incredibly new in this field, and am eager to learn from the best.
